# Skeleton Extras

This project provides a set of UI components built on [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/). It aims to provide simple to use responsive components that are not bloated with unnecessary features. Please note that there is (currently) no guarantee these components will work across multiple operating systems or browsers.
